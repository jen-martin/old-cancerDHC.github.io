# GitHub Issue Dashboard for the Center for Cancer Data Harmonization Project

This project creates a Gantt-chart style visualization to track progress made on the Center for Cancer Data Harmonization (CCDH) project. The CCDH project consists of five workstreams; each workstream logs progress on goals in a GitHub repo.

Workstream Name | GitHub Repo URL
--------------- | ---------------
Operations | https://github.com/cancerDHC/operations/issues
Community Development | https://github.com/cancerDHC/community-development/issues
Data Model Harmonization | https://github.com/cancerDHC/data-model-harmonization/issues
Ontology and Terminology Ecosystem | https://github.com/cancerDHC/Terminology/issues
Tools and Data Quality | https://github.com/cancerDHC/tools/issues

This visualation tool is based on Frappe Gantt (https://frappe.io/gantt) an open source JS library for creating Gantt charts.
